Cough Signature Analysis using Explainable AI — A two-stage deep learning system designed to 
separate noise from cough recordings and classify cough into COVID-19, Asthma, or Healthy. 
Supports audio file upload and live microphone input, and provides Explainable-AI visualizations 
(Grad-CAM/SHAP) to show why a prediction was made.

The goal of this project is *not to replace doctors*, but to support early detection and help 
individuals understand when to seek medical assistance.
